      title: 'Acoustic-Driven Surface Cleaning with Millimeter-Sized Bubbles at Translational Resonance',

      year: '2025',
      laySummary:

          <p className="mb-3">
            This work demonstrates a novel low-frequency translational resonance mode of millimetric
            bubbles in water and shows that driving bubbles at this resonance (around 45–50 Hz for
            ~0.65 mm radius bubbles) dramatically boosts surface cleaning compared to off-resonance
            or static conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            We model the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator in translation, with the
            restoring force arising from surface tension acting on curvature changes when the bubble
            deforms into an ellipsoid. The effective spring constant k<sub>eff</sub> ≈ σ (surface tension),
            and inertia is dominated by hydrodynamic added mass m<sub>eff</sub> = C<sub>A</sub> ρ<sub>f</sub> (4/3)πR₀³,
            yielding a natural frequency f<sub>peak</sub> ∝ R₀<sup>-3/2</sup>.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Experimental validation via PIV shows that only near resonance does the bubble centroid
            move faster than the surrounding fluid. We observe "stop-and-go" sliding dynamics on
            inclined surfaces that create transient high-shear events.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Cleaning Results:</strong> Bubbles driven at 50 Hz remove ~34% of protein-based
            artificial soil from glass slides, compared to ~18–19% at 0 or 130 Hz with bubbles, and
            only ~1.5% for submersion controls. This represents approximately a <strong>90% improvement</strong> in
            cleaning efficacy at resonance compared to non-resonant bubble cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work offers a low-frequency, non-cavitating alternative for surface cleaning with
            clear oscillator-based scaling laws suitable for rational design.

            Existing allocation rules like MELD prioritize urgency but may sacrifice total
            post-transplant life-years. Pure utilitarian rules that maximize expected benefit can be
            ethically troubling because they may repeatedly bypass the sickest patients for marginal
            predicted gains.

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Harm-Threshold Utilitarianism (HTU)</strong> retains the utilitarian goal of
            maximizing expected benefit but imposes two explicit constraints:

          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-3 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Epistemic threshold:</strong> Only act on differences in predicted utility that
              are statistically robust. We compute P(U<sub>i</sub> &gt; U<sub>j</sub>) and require
              this probability to exceed 1 − α (e.g., 0.95). Under Gaussian assumptions, this yields
              an uncertainty-adjusted utility μ<sup>adj</sup><sub>i</sub> = μ<sub>i</sub> − z σ<sub>i</sub>,
              where z = Φ<sup>-1</sup>(1 − α).

            <li>
              <strong>Catastrophic harm threshold:</strong> Avoid leaving patients with very high
              short-term mortality risk H<sub>i</sub> untransplanted purely for marginal predicted
              gains. Define H<sub>crit</sub> (e.g., 0.30 for 90-day mortality) and for each candidate i,
              compute N<sub>i</sub> = |{'{'}j ≠ i : H<sub>j</sub> ≥ H<sub>crit</sub>{'}'}|, the number of
              other patients who would remain above catastrophic risk if organ goes to i.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Allocation rule:</strong> Lexicographically minimize N<sub>i</sub> first, then
            maximize μ<sup>adj</sup><sub>i</sub> among tied candidates.

            <strong>Simulation results</strong> using de-identified OPTN/STAR liver transplant registry
            data (2002–2025) show that HTU yields approximately <strong>0.25 additional years</strong> (~3 months)
            of five-year restricted mean survival time (RMST) per transplant compared to MELD-based
            selection, while protecting the worst-off via the harm threshold.

          <p>
            Varying H<sub>crit</sub> traces out an urgency-efficiency frontier, making fairness
            trade-offs transparent and auditable. HTU embeds basic deontological constraints inside a
            utilitarian framework, providing a tunable, ethically explicit allocation rule.

              About one in five patients report activity restrictions at follow-up, with a mix of

              generally high.

          <p>
            THA patients, including younger and more active individuals, can usually return to sports.
            Surgical approach does not appear to make a major difference in return to sports at one
            year. Low-impact sports show better return rates, but even high-impact sports see
            substantial successful returns. THA can both restore and sometimes initiate sports
            participation.
